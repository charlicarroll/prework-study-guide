# <PREWORK-STUDY-GUIDE WEBPAGE>

## Description
This course is an attempt at occupying my old brain with a new topic, and since it is really new to me, I am doing the prework as an intro to this whole field.
I am realizing the complexity of the topic, and seeing the need for being obsessive in approach. The study guide as a webpage may turn out to be useful in the future, but just the experience of building it has been worthwhile.
